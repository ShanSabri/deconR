Description: Histone modification profiles are informative for understanding gene regulation for a given cell type. 
  However, current histone modification profiling technologies yield averaged profiles of a mixture of cells that mask
  individual cell type-specific profiles. This is a major shortcoming given that cellular variability is inherent in 
  most cell populations. The current method for single cell ChIP-seq has low per-cell sequencing coverage and exhibits
  a signal-to-noise ratio too high for meaningful interpretation. Here, we present a method that predicts chromatin maps
  at the single cell type level by jointly modeling population epigenetic data with single cell transcriptomics. We
  train a machine learning model to learn relationships between gene expression and chromatin features using a compendium 
  of data containing histone modification maps and gene expression profiles. To deconvolve the histone profiles of a complex
  mixture of cells we integrate two types of models that account for within- and across-cell type relationships. The 
  within-cell type model leverages information about expression of nearby genes, and the across-cell type model predicts 
  ChIP-seq profiles from the expression of all genes. Using these relationships, we can infer histone modification profiles 
  at the individual cell type level using single cell expression data. This allows us to annotate difference in cis-regulatory 
  sites, such as enhancers, between cell types from complex population of cells. We apply this framework to the context of 
  reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a process limited by low conversion efficiency 
  potentially due to epigenetic barriers that are difficult to overcome. It is unclear which chromatin changes allow some 
  cells to progress towards pluripotency. Our preliminary results suggest our model can predict cell type-specific enhancers 
  within somatic and iPSC populations solely from single cell gene expression data. Utilizing these different data types 
  will provide a foundation for understanding the regulatory program at the single cell or subpopulation level.
